# TEAM SBEV's BEAUTIFUL GITHUB REPOSITORY

This is where we share code.
If you aren't a contributor, ask me and I'll invite you.

# Installation

## Git
This project is best installed using git. Most users should have git preinstalled.

# Coding
All code you will be writing is in `Teamcode/src/main/java/org.firstinspires.teamcode.` Feel free to take a look at our code, the javadocs, and the examples located in `FtcRobotController/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller/external.samples`. If you're still stuck, ask me (Tom) or any of the other coders.

## Style
Use `camelCase` for variables; `PascalCase` for classes; `UPPER_CASE` for constants. For more, see [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html).
